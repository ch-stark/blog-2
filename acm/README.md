# Cluster Landing Zone for Hybrid and Multi-cloud Architectures

## Overview

Cluster landing zones provide a framework in which common organizational challenges with respect to network segmentation, failure domains and team boundaries when designing cluster deployment topologies for hybrid and multi-cloud architectures can be addressed. This is augmented with an operating model that provides tools and guidance on how to deal with day-to-day operational issues related to cluster lifecycling, application rollout in a multi-tenanted environment, governance, observability and disaster recovery. This article deals with the former as best practices pertaining to the latter is covered by multiple other articles on this blog site covering Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM).

## Designing for Hybrid and Multi-cloud Architectures

Let's dig a little deeper into what common design challenges enterprises face when migrating to cloud and deploying clusters at scale. Other than the obvious application-level concerns, the next layer down deals with the more challenging aspects of organisational context that manifest themselves as design demarcation points or trust boundaries, and inform the entprise architect how the cluster landing zone should be translated to the needs of the organization.

- network (internal-facing vs external-facing)
- environment (production vs non-production)
- location (on-premises vs cloud)
- team (often product aligned)
- domain (business support systems vs product platforms)

The purpose of trust boundaries is to establish an administrative span of control within the organization and in line with well-estalished architectural principles based on separation of concerns and least privilege amongst others. These boundaries and architectural principles on which they are based need to be reflected in the design of a cluster landing zone and are contributing factors to why a hybrid cloud architecture is distinct from a multi-cloud architecture. The number of boundaries and whether they can be dealt with inside the cluster or outside of a cluster to a large extent determine the overall cluster landing zone topology and potentially the total fleet size.

Modern computing architectures based around hybrid cloud adoption (defined here as a logical coalescing of cloud provider infrastructure into a single addressable unit) and multi-cloud (defined here as a disparate set of cloud provider infrastructure) are often abstracted using self-managing infrastructure orchestration platforms such as OpenShift with a view to enabling container-oriented workloads to run in a resilient, secure and portably manner underpinned by self-service and automation, to a varying degree. 

What both hybrid and multi-cloud architectures have in common is the segregation of the control plane from the data plane. The control plane (hub in RHACM numenclamenture) centralises all of the cluster management lifecycle functions and higher-level governance controls. It also facilitates distribution of user workloads down to the data plane (managed clusters in RHACM numenclamenture). The distinction between the two models ends there and whereas hybrid cloud architecture coalesce clusters hosted on separate cloud providers into a logically addressable unit managed by single hub (as shown in the first diagram below), the multi-cloud model (shown in the second diagram) operates these as disjoint entities managed by separate hubs. This may be an architectural nicety, but the impact of this is that only with a hybrid cloud model is it possible to run multi-cluster service load-balancing using technologies such as Submariner which require clusters to be defined within a common managed cluster set such that all the pod IPs across participating cluster namespaces are visible.

From an operational model the diagrams show that cluster provisioning activities including hardening and security are performed by IT Operations / SRE team across the fleet as would be expected with such a centralised model. In addition to that (but not mandatory) is the possibility of leveraging the hub for multi-tenanted application delivery.

For each application team a set of managed clusters is provisioned by the SRE team and bound to a team-specific namespace that hosts the GitOps engine (ArgoCD). The namespace is bound (via RHACM) to the managed cluster set that encapsulates the managed clusters that were provisioned. This ensures that even if the application team mis-configures their workflow and accidentally target another teams clusters that the effect is nil as only operations against the bound managed cluster set are allowed to go through. Furthermore the application team cannot run any containers inside this namespace, via Kubernetes RBAC roles assigned to the team they would only have access to placement and application set resources (more details below). If an application team wishes to further sub-divide responsibilities between members of the team, for example only one team member is allowed to deploy to production whilst the others can deploy to non-production then this finer level of segregation can be implemented using the RBAC capabilities within ArgoCD itself.

Labels, claims, placements and application sets are the API constructs the application will use to manage the deployment of their resources. An example based on the diagrams above is given. Let's say that the red wish to deploy their application to production. Here is what they would need to define:

A placement resource that selects the red team's production clusters across all clouds is as follows:

	apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
	kind: Placement
	metadata:
	  name: placement-red-clusters-prod
	  namespace: red-gitops
	spec:
	  predicates:
	    - requiredClusterSelector:
	      labelSelector:
	        matchExpressions:
	          - {key: env, operator: In, values: ["prod"]}

An application set that references the placement for deployment purposes:

	apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
	kind: ApplicationSet
	metadata:
	  name: my-app
	  namespace: red-gitops
	spec:
	  generators:
	    - clusterDecisionResource:
	      configMapRef: acm-placement
	      labelSelector:
	        matchLabels:
	          cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement: placement-red-clusters-prod
	      requeueAfterSeconds: 180
	  template:
	    metadata:
	      name: 'my-app-{{name}}'
	    spec:
	      project: default
	      source:
	        repoURL: # valid URL
	        targetRevision: main
	        path: # valid path
	      destination:
	        namespace: my-app
	        server: '{{server}}'
	      syncPolicy:
	        syncOptions:
	          - CreateNamespace=true
	          - PruneLast=true
	      automated:
	        prune: true
	        selfHeal: true

And that is everything. Behind the scenes controllers work to evaluate the placement configuration into a valid list of clusters based on the managed cluster set that is bound to the ArgoCD instance. This list will then be iterated over by ArgoCD to generate and apply one application to each matching cluster. The net result is two applications being deployed, one to the production cluster in AWS and the other to the production cluster in GCP.

A more complex placement example leveraging both labels and cluster claims that select the red team's non-production clusters in AWS only is as follows:

	apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
	kind: Placement
	metadata:
	  name: placement-red-clusters-nonprod
	  namespace: red-gitops
	spec:
	  predicates:
	  - requiredClusterSelector:
	      labelSelector:
	        matchExpressions:
	          - {key: env, operator: NotIn, values: ["prod"]}
	      claimSelector:
	        matchExpressions:
	          - {key: platform.open-cluster-management.io, operator: In, values: ["AWS"]}

The net result of this (assuming the same applicaiton set with an updated placement reference) would be two applications deployed, one to the staging cluster and the other to the development cluster in AWS only.

Unlike labels which are typically user-defined and should be specified at provisioning time (they can be changed later too), cluster claims are auto-generated by the RHACM provisioning system itself and provide a rich set of semantics that can be used to distinguish clusters and clouds. The upshot is that at no time does the application team need to reference the cluster name which is important when using a dynamic cluster provisioning strategy as described in this prior blog:

As an side, some advantages of this architectur is that it facilitates a "cluster-per-team" approach which has some inherenet benefits such as reduced blast radius, decoupled maintenance windows, ad hoc restart along with bespoke scaling and cluster version. The downsides is the increased cost which can be mitigated via solutions such as HyperShift in which control planes are co-hosted on the hub.

The model described thus far carries through to multi-cloud architecture in which the clusters for each cloud are managed by a dedicated hub. In turn each of the "leaf" hubs can be managed by a "root" hub (also known as a hub-of-hubs architecture) if there is a requirement to maintain some level of centralised control and compliance. The multi-cloud model does have more flexibility in terms of support for more complex organizational structures such as when dealing with multiple legal entities or divisions, where decentralised IT ownership is still practiced. It also deals well with assymetric cloud architectures.

## Conclusion

Cluster landing zones are useful to model and implement hybrid and multi-cloud topologies based on well-defined trust boundaries within the enterprise. With a carefully considered multi-tenancy model and using integrated tooling such as ArgoCD the hub also serves the needs of application teams. Using the various multi-cluster lifecycle, governance, observability tools shipped with RHACM enables the SRE to fully implement and operate a cluster landing zone tailored to the needs of their enterprise.
